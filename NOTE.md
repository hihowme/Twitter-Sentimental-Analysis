## NOTE ABOUT THIS PROJECT

When I was doing this project, I ran into some issues and I realized that I cannot do this project like what 
I wrote in the proposal, therefore I made some changes. Here is a note about the challenges that I ran into
and the deviation from the proposal.

## 1. The strong anti-crawler in Weibo

First of all, it is not that easy to run weibo API just like `tweepy`, therefore
we have to use the web-crawler if we want to get the information of Weibo posts.
However, Weibo has a strong anti-crawler tech which makes it difficult to successfully
do the web scraping job.

## 2. Limitations of Twitter developer account
Due to the limitation of the Twitter developer API, the maximum number of tweets to analyze is 800.

## 3. The drawbacks of learning deep-learning to do nlp
The overall accuracy is 0.728, which is not that good. In the future, we will combine stochastic search method to the Sequential modelling process and try to get a better prediction.
